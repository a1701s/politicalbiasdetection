# distilbert-political-tweets ðŸ—£ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

This model is a fine-tuned version of [distilbert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased) on the [m-newhauser/senator-tweets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/m-newhauser/senator-tweets) dataset, which contains all tweets made by United States senators during the first year of the Biden Administration.
It achieves the following results on the evaluation set:
* Accuracy: 0.9076
* F1: 0.9117

## Model description

The goal of this model is to classify short pieces of text as having either Democratic or Republican sentiment. The model was fine-tuned on 99,693 tweets (51.6% Democrat, 48.4% Republican) made by US senators in 2021.

Model accuracy may not hold up on pieces of text longer than a tweet.
